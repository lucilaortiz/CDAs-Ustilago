The following files are available:
* sequences_125_used_for_CDAsBasidios_Tree.txt: Different sequences of CDAs are identified of diferent groups of Basidiomycota (Agaricomycotina, Pucciniomycotina, Ustilaginomycotina).

* Newick_CDAsBasidios_LGFIG5_500_rootMAD: The evolutionary history was inferred by using the Maximum Likelihood method based on the Le Gascuel with Freqs model, a discrete Gamma distribution with Invariant sites was used was rooted using the minimal deviation of ancestors (MAD) method.
