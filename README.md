"Cell wall Chitosan is necessary for full virulence in the  biotrophic Basidiomycota Ustilago maydis" Angélica Mariana Robledo-Briones, José Alejandro Sánchez-Arreguin, M. Lucila Ortiz-Castellanos, Claudia Geraldine León-Ramírez, David Martinez-Cano and José Ruiz-Herrera

The following files are available:
* 125_sequences_used_for_CDAs_Tree.txt: Different sequences of CDAs are identified of diferent groups of Basidiomycota (Agaricomycotina, Pucciniomycotina, Ustilaginomycotina).

* Newick_CDAsBasidios_LGFIG5_500_rootMAD: The evolutionary history was inferred by using the Maximum Likelihood method based on the Le Gascuel with Freqs model, a discrete Gamma distribution with Invariant sites was used was rooted using the minimal deviation of ancestors (MAD) method.
